# AI Project 2: Cancer Dataset Study

## Overview

This project is a cancer dataset study aiming to determine wether or not a cancer is benign or malignant according to 30 different features. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erdemtaha/cancer-data).

The code was developed in Python 3.10 with Jupyter Notebook.

## Algorithms

The following models were studied:

* Decision Trees
* Neural Networks
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression

## Running the Code

As the project was done on Jupyter Notebook, it is needed to run our code.

### Dependencies

The dependencies needed to run the code are present in the `requirements.txt` file. They can be installed using the following command:

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
